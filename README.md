**Overview**

This project features a light tracking system using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The system utilizes Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) to detect and follow the light source with the highest intensity. Additionally, it includes an IR remote control function, allowing for manual operation. This dual functionality makes the project versatile and suitable for various applications.

**Features**

-**Automatic Light Tracking:** The system automatically adjusts its position to follow the light source using LDR sensors.           
-**Manual Control:** Users can manually control the system using an IR remote, providing flexibility and precise control.     
-**LCD Display:** An LCD display provides real-time feedback and status updates, ensuring easy monitoring and user interaction.  
-**Smooth Operation:** Ensures reliable and efficient motor control in both automatic and manual modes.
-**Mode Switching:** Easily toggle between automatic light tracking and manual control using the IR remote.


**Automatic Light Tracking Mode**

1.The LDR sensors continuously monitor the ambient light levels.             
2.The system compares the readings from the LDR sensors to determine the direction with the highest light intensity.                        
3.The motors adjust the position to align with the light source, ensuring the system always points towards the brightest light.

**Manual Control Mode**

1.The IR receiver decodes signals from the IR remote.                  
2.Based on the input, the system moves in the desired direction (up, down, left, or right).               
3.Users can switch between automatic and manual modes using designated buttons on the IR remote.

**Applications**

- **Solar Trackers:** Optimize solar panel positioning to maximize sunlight exposure.
- **Educational Projects:** Great for learning about sensors, motor control, and embedded systems.
